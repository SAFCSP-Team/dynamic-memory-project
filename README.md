# Dynamic memory project 

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to create pointer using dynamic memory allocation operators as followa:
<br/>
(new) and delete the pointer using (delete).

### Problem

Create double pointer and perfoem the following operations on it:

### Implementation

1. Declare double pointer using (new) dynamic memory operator.
2. Assighn a value to the double pointer.
3. Print the pointer value.
4. Delete the pointer value using (delete) dynamic memory operator.
<br/>
<br/>
  
```cpp

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){

    /*
    Add your code here
    1. declare double pointer using (new) dynamic memory operator
    */

    /*
    Add your code here
    2. Assighn a value to the double pointer;
    */

    /*
    Add your code here
    3. print the pointer value
    */


    /*
    Add your code here
    4. delete the pointer value using (delete) dynamic memory operator
    */    

    return 0;
};


```
