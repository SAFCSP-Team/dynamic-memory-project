# Dynamic memory project 

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to create and delete pointers using dynamic memory allocation operators.
<br/>
### Problem

Create a pointer of type double and perform the following operations on it.

### Implementation

1. Declare a pointer of type double using the (new) dynamic memory operator.
2. Assign a value to the pointer.
3. Print the pointer value.
4. Delete the pointer value using the (delete) dynamic memory operator.
<br/>
<br/>
  
```cpp

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){

    /*
    Add your code here
    1. declare a double pointer using the (new) dynamic memory operator
    */

    /*
    Add your code here
    2. Assign a value to the double pointer;
    */

    /*
    Add your code here
    3. print the pointer value
    */


    /*
    Add your code here
    4. delete the pointer value using the (delete) dynamic memory operator
    */    

    return 0;
};


```
